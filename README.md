# DataQuest Project 19: Handwritten Digits Classifiers (kNN and NN)

This is the 19th project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project two different machine learning models, a k-neighbors classifier and a neural network were constructed and applied to a dataset of handwritten digits. They were then optimized and their efficacy was tested. Later the pros and cons of the two different models were analyzed.

The educational goal of the project was to use a neural network as a classifier and to understand the advantages and drawbacks to using this complex machine learning model.

## Prerequisites

This project requires only the Jupyter notebook containing the completed project.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
